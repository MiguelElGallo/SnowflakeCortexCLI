## Discussion-first workflow

Before opening an Issue, start a GitHub Discussion to align on the problem and proposed approach.
When opening an Issue, include the Discussion URL.

## Safe collaboration defaults

Use these repository settings to keep `main` protected:

1. Require a pull request before merging.
2. Require at least 1 approval.
3. Require status checks to pass (at minimum: `Docs PR Check / docs-build`).
4. Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.
5. Restrict direct pushes to `main`.

These settings are managed in GitHub repository settings and cannot be fully enforced from repository files alone.
